_Base template for transversal projects in the AI Engineering Career Program — 4Geeks Academy._

> _Instrucciones disponibles en español en [README.es.md](./README.es.md)._

---

## Purpose

This repository is the **starter template** for transversal projects. You will work on real company scenarios (Brasaland, TrackFlow, Nexova), building deliverables that map to course milestones (Web, Programming, Backend, Telemetry, RAG, Agents, Workflows, Real-time).

- Create a template from this repository.
- Replace the placeholder `CONTEXT.md` with your assigned company context.
- Use `skills/` and the directory-level `README.md` files as working guidance.

---

## Current status of the template

The repository currently provides a **base folder structure and documentation skeleton** with an initial Brasaland-focused working baseline.

- `CONTEXT.md` already includes Brasaland company context.
- A root `AGENTS.md` is available with priorities and guardrails.
- Initial deliverables were added under `docs/`, `workflows/`, `services/brasaland-api/`, and `uis/executive-dashboard/`.
- Shared package metadata exists in `packages/shared/package.json` (`@repo/shared-types`), but no workspace runner is configured at root.

## Recent updates

- MVP API running in `services/brasaland-api/` with sales, market, finance, CSV export, and audit endpoints.
- MVP executive dashboard in `uis/executive-dashboard/`, connected to local API with demo fallback mode.
- Reproducible, self-contained QA suite:
	- `workflows/scripts/smoke_api.sh`
	- `workflows/scripts/integration_api.sh`
	- `workflows/scripts/integration_data_api.sh`
- Chained CI in GitHub Actions:
	- `Smoke API` -> `Integration API` -> `Integration Data API`
- ES/EN documentation aligned across root README, `services/`, `uis/`, `workflows/`, and main submodules.

## How to start

1. **Use this repository as a template** and create your own project repo.
2. **Clone** your repository (or open it in Codespaces).
3. **Replace** `CONTEXT.md` with the full context for your assigned company.
4. **Review** each top-level folder `README.md` to understand intended responsibilities (`uis/`, `services/`, `data/`, `skills/`, etc.).
5. **Start implementing** milestone deliverables in `uis/` and `services/`, reusing `packages/shared/` and `data/` as needed.

Quick local tip (Brasaland API):

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap_local_env.sh
```

Then start the API:

```bash
bash scripts/run_api_local.sh
```

To stop the local API:

```bash
bash scripts/stop_api_local.sh
```

To restart the local API:

```bash
bash scripts/restart_api_local.sh
```

To run full local QA in one command:

```bash
bash scripts/run_qa_local.sh
```

To run full dev cycle (restart + QA + cleanup):

```bash
bash scripts/dev_cycle.sh
```

To validate local environment prerequisites:

```bash
bash scripts/check_env.sh
```

Note: `run_api_local.sh` and `restart_api_local.sh` already run this preflight automatically.

Optional (manual bootstrap if needed):

```bash
cd services/brasaland-api
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
